# Pok√© Tab

## What does it do?
Display a collection (30) of pokemon sprites animated with JavaScript to move around the screen. 

## How does it work?
It uses the DOM to display the sprites and JavaScript to animate them, primarily using an recursive setTimeout(). Vue js
is used to make coding the options panel easier.

To use the app, either be entranced and watch the pokemon move around all day, or click anywhere in the browser window to
open the options pane. From there let your creativity run wild.

## What's next?
Well now that all pokemon up to and including Gen 9 have been added, there are still tons of other features that i'd like
to add...

So next steps would be:
- Add Shiny Charm (naturally it would increase the odds of a shiny appearing when adding pokemon to the page)
- Add Pokeballs
- Add beautiful pixel style backgrounds

## Chrome Extension

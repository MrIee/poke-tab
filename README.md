# Pok√© Tab

## What does it do?
Display a collection (30) of pokemon sprites animated with JavaScript to move around the screen. 

## How does it work?
It uses the DOM to display the sprites and JavaScript to animate them, primarily using an recursive setTimeout(). Vue js
is used to make coding the options panel easier.

To use the app, either be entranced and watch the pokemon move around all day, or click anywhere in the browser window to
open the options pane. From there let your creativity run wild.

## What's next?
Well currently it only support the first 151 pokemon, mostly due to my eagerness to start testing the concept.

So next steps would be:
- Add the rest of the pokemon.
- Add beautiful pixel style backgrounds
